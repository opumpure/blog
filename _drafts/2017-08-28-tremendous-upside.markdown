There is one big problem with a day job. The potential growth if any at all is linear. Whereas the risk that comes with it is exponential.

We live in an ever changing world where the pace of things keeps increasing. Hundreds of years ago one perhaps felt more confident that the trade they picked will be in demand their whole lifetime, and even their children lifetimes. Today the likelihood of [disruptive innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disruptive_innovation) is higher than ever.

My theory has always been that programming will be the last profession to dissapear (we are a fairly sturdy bunch). We keep hearing how robots are taking away jobs from the middle class. Lets say this is true and soon we will have robots doing everything from grocarie store shelf stacking to complicated heart surgeries. As we know the robots have to be told what and how to do, or basically they have to programmed. There we go. This is more like a dream thought for me though.

From the moment we set foot in this world we are being tought how to be successful. When I was a kid somebody told me that programmers earn a lot of money. They didn't tell how that might change.

### The Barbell Strategy.

It is mostly known for its application in the investment world. There are low risk investments that have low returns, and there are high risk and speculative investments that have the potential for high returns. Most common advice is to find an acceptable balance between risk and reward. But is the most rewarding one? The Barbell Strategy teaches the opposite, stay as far from the middle as possible.

It is also based on idea that the riskless guearanteed income might not be riskless nor guearanteed after all, because of potential error in those predictions.
