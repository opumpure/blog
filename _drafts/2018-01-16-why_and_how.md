## Why and How

There are 2 questions that we often get mixed up with and get lost in - why and how. If one thinks of an idea or a better way of doing something, they can be soon give up because the how doesn't come right away. Or the other way would be that one things of how to optimize a piece of code for example, they know "how", but forget the "why". We end up with quite a bit of confusion.

How to manage a steady pipeline of improvements?

I am proposing to do it like this. First think of why, know the added business value etc. Then think of how, and the main thing here is to not be discouraged and accept that there might be a learning curve. (Reference to Devternity speech about managed learning)

(Example with monitoring)
