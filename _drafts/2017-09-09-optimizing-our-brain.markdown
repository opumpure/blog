Our brain is a very intriguing organ. It is made up of interconnected neurons that simply process a bunch of signals. In order to get smarter we need to improve this neural network. Most of the time we don't do  it consciously or directly. What if we could?

Basically the brain solves problems, so computer scientists have wondered if they could simulate the neural network on computers and solve problems using the CPU. It turns out they can and quite [successfully](TODO). It is hard to understand how it all just happens in our brain, but by simplyfing for simulation on computers we can start comprehending it.

There are many good [tutorials](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/) that explain the artifical neural networks. For the purpose of this post I will just say that neural networks consist of data inputs, neurons and data outputs. Information is put into the network which spits out the answer. When the neuron receives a bit of information it decides whether to fire or not. By firing the neuron passes information further to another neuron. In the end the answer is fired or spit out.

Of course, in order for the result to be meaningful we first need to meaninglully set up the neural network itself and then train it.

### Adding the weight

The core idea behind training is adding weights to the data.

The natural brain is a living and always changing organ. When we learn something new our neural network is modified so that it produces correct answers. However, there are lots of problems which are so complicated that we can't be 100% sure if it is the right answer. I always feel that my neural network is flipping back and forth and is pretty confused most of the time. The weights are being changed all the time! So here are a few tricks to bring some stability:

* Do work that has tangible results
* Work in sprints and take frequent rests
* Eliminate distractions
* Reward yourself
* Make commitments
* Write about it

I hope there won't be any neuro scientists reading this post (giggle).
