## Program, Not Test

Nearly every programmer during their career has come across legacy code. Functionality that has been put together over multiple years and now works (within reason) in production. When you approach this code in order to change it, do you not ask to yourself, what sort of tests have been done to make sure this works? As we can imagine, multiple years of coding would have seen countless iterations where a new block of code would have been added, and some sort of test would be made to make sure it works. We can divide coding in two simple steps - writing the actual code, then making sure it works. Here lays the problem, only half the work has remained with the project - the actual code, whereas the other half (the major half, I would argue) has simply vanished.
