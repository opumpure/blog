If you look at a piece of code and have to use your brain to understand what is going on, there is something very terribly wrong with it.

## It should read like a book

A page turner.

Some 10 years ago we used forums to solve programming problems. Where have they dissapeared? [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) has solved it by giving a solution where we don't need to think. Literally, it takes 2 seconds to scan the answer to determine whether it applies to what you are searching for.

The expectation isn't that the code would be easily understood by a 5 year old. Neither by any other non programmer. Just the same as the proof of [Fermat's Last Theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/FermatsLastTheorem.html) isn't an afternoon read for a non mathematician.

Programmers must be too smart, so they are seen as a resource that can be wasted.
There are only so many thoughts to be had.

Nothing changes depending on the company size. It is exactly the same both in Riga, Latvia and London, UK.

Progress can't be made.
Imagine the potential.
A wake up call.

There are other things to think about.
