# About Me

I'm Rudolfs Pumpurs, a programmer.

I would like to think that my skills aren't limited to that. However, it is the only skill that I have been able to sell to anybody so far.

This blog contains ideas about software and the industry. The way code is written these days is painfully sub-optimal. Therefore ideas need to be had.
